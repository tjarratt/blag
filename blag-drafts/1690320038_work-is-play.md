# Work is Play

Listen, I've had some good jobs, I've had some bad jobs. There's a lot to say about bad jobs but there is one simple fact that separates the good jobs from the bad.

Every single good job I've had made me feel like I was having a good time. Work was playful, a joy. Even in the stressful moments, there was camaraderie, and support. Bad jobs are always an endless grind. An endless soul-sucking experience is not joyful. Games are joyful. What if ... work felt as care-free as a game ?

# What makes a good job ?

There are a few necessary preconditions for a job to be great

1. What's expected of you is clear
1. You have what you need to do your job
1. You have the opportunity to do your best every day
1. In the past seven days you've received recognition for good work
1. Someone at work cares about you as a person
1. Someone at work encourages your development
1. Your opinions seem to count
1. The mission or purpose of the company makes you feel your work is important
1. Your coworkers are committed to doing quality work
1. You have a best friend at work
1. In the past six months you've talked to someone about your progress
1. In the past year you've had opportunities to grow and learn

Now, not every job can deliver on all of these, but the more it does, the better your experience will be. I didn't pull this list out of my ass -- this list was the result of 25 years of research and 80k interviews across multiple industries by the Gallop Organisation ; you can read more about this in the book [_First Break All The Rules_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50937.First_Break_All_the_Rules).

Now, my claim is that work is play, so let's take a closer look at games.

# What makes a good game ?

Intuitively, we all know what makes a good game, but it can be hard to put it into words. Luckily, Bernard Suits did this for us in the 70s. As quoted by C Thi Nguyen recently in [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-c-thi-nguyen.html) we have this definition

> To play a game is to voluntarily take on unnecessary obstacles for the sake of making possible the activity of overcoming them

Thanks to Capitalism (shakes fist at the sky) all of us need to have a job to pay our bills and survive, therefore we are all clearly taking on certain obstacles through choice. We could choose some boring, mindless job, but instead we choose something that challenges and stimulates us, for the purpose of growing as individuals (or maybe it's just for the free snacks). Clearly for those of us working in the Emergency Room, Urgent Care, and First Responders the stakes are higher ; the same is true to some degree if you're maintaining a production system that hundreds of thousands of people depend upon. Whether you're working to save lives or working on critical infrastructure the choice is ours to rise to the occasion and overcome the challenge. CRUD apps, stakeholder management, enterprise software are significantly lower stakes admittedly, but in the heat of the moment they are no less of a challenge -- just ask any junior consultant.

In a recent article on [Winnable and Unwinnable Games](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-229-winnable-and-unwinnable-games) John Cutler, broke down the differences between good and bad games. From either a product management or game development point of view, there's a lot to learn here, but let's focus on what makes a good game.

> Consider the things that make a good game. Good games have 

1. Clear, attainable goals, that players understand
1. Maintain a balance of difficulty
1. Timely feedback and rewards, boosting player motivation
1. Engaging gameplay mechanics captivating players and sustain(ing) their interest
1. Signs of small victories or incremental progress ... 
1. Meaningful choices that impact the outcome
1. Immerse players in a compelling environment or narrative
1. Calibrate progression and learning curves, promoting mastery over time
1. Variety in challenges ... (to) keep players engaged
1. Social interactions, such as competitive or cooperative play
1. Accessibility in terms of difficulty and controls
1. High replayability ensures the game remains fresh and exciting for repeated plays

Think back to a few games you've played before. From the latest entry in the Zelda or Mario series, to Grand Theft Auto, to jenga, settlers of catan, [pÃ©tanque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9tanque), or escape games, we see all of these principles in our favorite games.

Let's take mario for an example

> Clear, attainable goals, that players understand

Run right, don't fall in holes, jump on enemies heads and don't stop until you get to the end. So easy a child could do it.

> Maintain a balance of difficulty

World 1 Level 1 couldn't start simpler. A goomba, a few blocks and no pits to fall into. Childplay.

> Timely feedback and rewards

Jump and stomp the goomba, or miss and start the level over again.

> Engaging gameplay mechanics

Who hasn't lost an hour (or a day) playing Mario before ?

> Signs of small victories or incremental progress

Levels are bite-sized and even getting further and dying in a level can feel like progress

> Meaningful choices that impact the outcome

Mario is full of meaningful choices. Do you take a riskier path and get an upgrade ? Run fast and hope to miss the enemies ? Or play it safe and go slow ?

> Immerse players in a compelling environment or narrative

Playing mario can make you feel like __you are mario__.

> Calibrate progression and learning curves, promoting mastery over time

Within a world, the levels get harder, but when you get to a new world, it starts easier again.

> Variety in challenges ... (to) keep players engaged

Some levels have lots of pits. Some levels have lots of enemies to avoid. A literal variety of challenges.

> Social interactions, such as competitive or cooperative play

Not necessarily built into Mario, but I recall many afternoons with a few friends each taking a turn to see how far we could get.

> Accessibility in terms of difficulty and controls

When a five year old can start playing a game, it's certainly accessible.

> High replayability ensures the game remains fresh and exciting for repeated plays

Some people play Mario to see how quickly they can beat the game. Others to avoid getting hit even once. Others just to see if they can get a higher score.

## wrap it up, some how ?

This is a clever call to action to fucking be nice to each other, shitheads.
