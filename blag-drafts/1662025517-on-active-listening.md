## Active Listening

Have you ever spoken to someone and had a hard time understanding them ? Of course, you're human, this is an every day occurence.

I have an important skill to talk to you about.

But first, a story about TDD and how words don't have intrinsic meaning

What happened ?

What could we have done ?

How do we avoid this ?

We practice active listening.

What is active listening ?
--------------------------
When you are having a conversation with someone and they make a statement, you say "I hear you say" and repeat the statement back.

That's it ?

That's it.

There's got to be a catch
-------------------------
Not really. At its basic level, active listening is a practice to observe a speaker and reflect back what you've heard. This creates mutual understanding, helps to ensure the message that was received was the one that was delivered, and helps with retaining knowledge, by increasing engagement.

Often when we state something, we aren't thinking that much about the words that we say. We have a point to make and the words are secondary to the point we want to make. Unfortunately, when we talk to someone they don't have our point, all they have are our words that we pronounce. Hearing our words said back to us forces us to listen to what we're saying and reflect on whether it conveys the right message.
