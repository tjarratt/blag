On Being Interviewed
=====================

A few months ago, my old friend Clint Hill started a new project called Attainable Engineering. His goal is to write about engineering, mentorship, and to highlight the paths towards growth that many people don't find. In an ideal world, reaching the highest level of our craft should be attainable for everyone. I think that's quite an honorable goal.

You should read through some of his interviews and articles, they're quite good. For example, a few months back he interviewed Kelsey Hightower, Staff Developer Advocate at Google, and author of Kubernetes : The Hard Way.

Kelsey is a hard act to follow, and I was floored to find that Clint was going to publish my interview with him. Getting interviewed isn't an activity engineers do often, and writing about it less often. I thought this could be a good opportunity to talk about an important soft skill that a lot of people in our industry are sleeping on.
